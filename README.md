#Udacity P5: Neighborhood Map (40 hrs)
[Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)

Project Directions: You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

##Technologies Used

##Challenges

####Film Location Data Quality
I used [SF Open Data - Film Locations in San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am), provided by the [San Francisco Film Office](http://filmsf.org/sf-locations). This data contained many misspellings and incomplete
address information. 

##Technologies Used

###APIs Used
* Google Maps JavaScript API 
* Google Street View Image API
* [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) at themoviedb.org is free to use and very thorough. I'm using a library created by [Franco Cavestri](https://github.com/cavestri/themoviedb-javascript-library/wiki)
* The [New York Times API - The Movie Reviews API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie_reviews_api/) is high quality and easy-to-use. I include their movie reviews.

####Other APIs I tried:
* IMDB is not free anymore, sadly, as they provide the most comprehensive film information.
* Rotten Tomatoes is free for 6 months but they approved my API too late to use for this project.
* omdbapi.com is free but has very limited data.
* [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/insert#parameters) has trailers but the results were often wrong even with 
an exact match. It uses the same API
as Google Maps and consumed a large percentage of my API calls. I would use
their API if my project required more general videos that merely
required categories since their API is easy-to-use and well-documented.
```
https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?part=snippet&maxResults=5&q=Godzilla+Official+Extended+Trailer+(2014)&relevanceLanguage=en&type=video&videoEmbeddable=true&key={YOUR_API_KEY}
```
* Wikipedia does not provide the film images since they often
use copyrighted images under a fair use law that I doubt my app 
also falls under.
* Flickr provided inconsistent image results. I like how the SF Film Office includes [frequently used locations](http://www.filmsf.org/sf-locations), for example [Alamo Square](https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=alamo+square)
* Netflix no longer has a free API. 
* [Trailer Addict API](http://www.traileraddict.com/trailerapi), used by The NY Times for their trailers, is slow. I imagine the free and public version is why it's mainly used by publishers as a paid service.  

####Possible APIs To Add:

* SendGrid - SendGrid is for transactional email and MailChimp is for marketing emails. A user sending themselves movie favorites in this app would be transactional.
* Rotten Tomatos API since I have 6 months access now.
* Yelp, Foursquare, Instagram, Facebook, Meetup & Twitter.
* A user could plan a route of locations and films and share their plans on Facebook or Meetup. Then update Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter with pictures.

####Knockout
We were required to use [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) for our organizational library, a MVVM. It provides:
* ViewModel: Knockout's ViewModel separates the Model and the View. 
* Declarative Bindings: Allows you to connect View and Model in direct and simple way.
* Automatic UI Refresh: Updates View when Model changes, and with declarative bindings, Knockout updates the Model when View changes.
* Dependency Tracking: Create a relationship between parts of the Model.

###Known Bugs and Issues
* There are at least 5 TV shows that come up with zero results: 
Hemingway & Gelhorn, CSI, Alcatraz. Use themoviedb API call for TV
* Blocks fail to map. The SF Data file sometimes gives you 3 streets to show a scene on a block. Usually it will say, "between" or "from" between the streets which can be used to create a start and end location

###Potential New Features:
* Real-Time Geolocation Service with Node.js
[http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/10/11/real-time-geolocation-service-with-node-js/](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/10/11/real-time-geolocation-service-with-node-js/)
* Ability to favorite locations
* themoviedb.org: Take advantage of this more encompassing API call, the multi or append_to_response which allows you to make one call instead of several Otherwise it only allows 40 calls/10 seconds:
```
 testDB = function() {
                // http://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/multi
                // https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/63?api_key=###&append_to_response=credits,images
                function successCB(data) {}

                function errorCB(data) {}

                theMovieDb.collections.getCollection({ "id": 10, "append_to_response": "trailers" }, successCB, errorCB);
}
```
* "Plan My Route" button with Geolocation using device GPS
* Take advantage of material design and Polymer
* Spinner when film loads
* History API for unique urls
* LocalStorage, Firebase, web workers and IndexDB
* [Custom Controls](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/controls#CustomControls)
 Take advantage of [underscore.string library.](http://gabceb.github.io/underscore.string.site/#capitalize)
