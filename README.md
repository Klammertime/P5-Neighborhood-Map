###Resources

I used the following resources:

* Removing markers

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/marker-remove

* Autocomplete Form

https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/html5_datalist_with_knockout_js

* Value vs. TextInput

http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/textinput-binding.html

* This is the best documentation I've ever used. 

[Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)


* [Pluralsight - Google Maps API: Get Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/google-maps-api-get-started/table-of-contents)

While the general instructions are all relevant, this is from 2014, therefore
some of the Google Maps API code has been updated. Refer to the docs
for specific code but you can use this for general tips and advice as I 
did. He's a good teacher. 

* [Treehouse - Adding a Dynamic Map by Andrew Chalkey](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-an-interactive-website/google-maps-integration/adding-a-dynamic-map-2)

This tutorial is also helpful but old.
Video -  Adding a Dynamic Map:
This showed me how to make the map responsive and move its center based on the window resize event. When the map is idle, the current center is stored.
